## Strategic Role in the Ecosystem

idfkit.com is the **credibility and adoption surface** — it's what people see before they decide to try the tools:

1. **First impression.** For energy modelers evaluating tools, the website's quality signals whether idfkit is a hobby project or a professional ecosystem.
2. **Grant narrative support.** When grant reviewers or institutional partners visit, they should immediately understand what idfkit does, who it serves, and why it matters.
3. **Adoption funnel.** The site should guide different personas (developer, modeler, student, institution) to the right entry point — `pip install idfkit` for programmers, Envelop for visual users, documentation for evaluators.
4. **Community signal.** Open-source badges, contribution links, and transparent governance communicate the non-profit, community-driven nature of the project.

## Opportunities

- **Documentation hub:** Centralize links to docs for all products (currently each repo has its own docs).
- **Impact storytelling:** Case studies, user testimonials, climate impact metrics.
- **Institutional landing pages:** Dedicated pages for universities, national labs, and professional societies explaining how to adopt idfkit in their workflows.
- **Blog/changelog:** Regular updates to demonstrate project health and momentum.
- **Internationalization:** Content translation for non-English-speaking regions, especially those in the Global South where access matters most.
