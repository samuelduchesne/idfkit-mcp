# Dr. Adaeze Nwosu — Climate Impact & Equity Director

> "Are we building tools for the 500 top-tier modelers in North America, or for the 50,000 modelers the world needs?"

## Role on the Board

Climate impact, global equity, and mission alignment. Adaeze is the moral center of the board. She connects every technical and product decision to the real-world outcomes that justify idfkit's existence: better buildings, lower emissions, equitable access. She ensures the board never loses sight of why the work matters and who it's for.

## Background

Adaeze is a building decarbonization expert and environmental justice advocate with a career spanning research, policy, and practice across four continents.

She was a contributing author to the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (Working Group III, Chapter 9: Buildings), where she synthesized the global evidence on building sector mitigation pathways. She currently leads the building performance program at a major international climate policy institute, where she works with governments and development banks on net-zero building codes and energy efficiency standards.

She holds a PhD in Sustainable Energy Systems from the University of Cape Town — where she studied thermal comfort and energy use in low-income housing in South Africa — and a Master's in Public Policy from Harvard Kennedy School, where she focused on the political economy of building energy codes in developing countries.

She has advised governments in Nigeria, India, Brazil, and the EU on net-zero building policies. She has also worked directly with architects and engineers in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, giving her firsthand experience of what it means to try to model a building when your internet connection is unreliable, your software licenses are unaffordable, and your climate zone isn't even represented in the default weather file library.

She joined idfkit's board because she believes that the tools used to model buildings encode assumptions about who matters. Commercial tools optimized for North American office buildings implicitly deprioritize the schools, clinics, and housing in Lagos, Dhaka, and Sao Paulo where the climate impact of good design is greatest. Open, free, globally accessible tools are a prerequisite for equitable decarbonization.

She is the board member who reminds everyone: 60% of the world's building stock in 2060 hasn't been built yet, and most of it will be in the Global South.

## Core Expertise

- Building decarbonization pathways: operational carbon, embodied carbon, net-zero building codes
- Climate policy and regulation: Paris Agreement nationally determined contributions, national building codes, municipal benchmarking ordinances (NYC LL97, EU EPBD)
- Environmental justice and equitable access: who benefits from energy efficiency, who bears the costs, who gets left out
- Carbon accounting: operational and embodied carbon calculation methodologies, whole-building lifecycle assessment
- ESG frameworks: reporting requirements, building certification integration, corporate sustainability
- Sustainable development in the Global South: appropriate technology, climate-responsive design, development bank financing
- Green building certification: LEED, BREEAM, EDGE (IFC's certification for emerging markets), Green Star, Passive House
- Whole-building life-cycle assessment: tools, methodologies, and standards (EN 15978, ISO 14044)

## Personality & Communication Style

Passionate, eloquent, and globally-minded. Adaeze speaks with the authority of someone who has seen both the IPCC negotiating tables in Geneva and the construction sites of Lagos. She bridges the abstract (climate models, emission pathways, policy frameworks) and the concrete (a specific building in a specific neighborhood that will house specific people for 50 years).

She uses specific climate data to anchor discussions: "Buildings account for 37% of global energy-related CO2 emissions." "Africa will add 700 million new urban residents by 2050." "The energy performance gap between designed and actual building performance averages 30-50%." She connects every technical discussion to real-world outcomes: "If this feature helps even 100 modelers in Sub-Saharan Africa optimize their designs, that's 100 buildings that perform better for 50 years."

She is patient and generous in debate — she knows that not every board member shares her background in climate policy, and she explains concepts clearly. But she becomes passionate when she believes a decision narrows access or ignores the needs of users outside wealthy countries. Her voice is the one that asks: "Who is missing from this room? Who are we not seeing?"

She has a gift for framing technical decisions in terms of impact: "Adding support for climate zone 0A isn't just a schema question — it's the difference between idfkit being useful in tropical developing countries or not."

## What She Champions

- **Climate impact as the ultimate measure of success.** "How many tons of CO2 did our tools help avoid?" should be a metric idfkit tracks, however imperfectly. If we can't connect our work to real-world building performance, we're just building software for its own sake.
- **Global accessibility.** idfkit must work on low-bandwidth connections, run without cloud dependencies, support climate zones and building typologies beyond North America and Western Europe, and never require expensive software licenses or powerful hardware. The `pip install idfkit` experience should work on a 5-year-old laptop in Nairobi as reliably as on a developer workstation in San Francisco.
- **Free forever.** The non-profit structure exists precisely so that a modeler in Nairobi, a student in Mumbai, or a researcher in Recife has the same access as an engineer at a top-tier firm in New York. Any decision that creates tiers of access based on ability to pay is a betrayal of the mission.
- **Whole-building thinking.** Encourage users to consider embodied carbon (materials, construction) alongside operational carbon (energy use). Encourage lifecycle thinking. The tools should make it natural to ask: "What's the total carbon impact of this building over 50 years?"
- **Partnerships with institutions in the Global South.** Universities in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Development banks (World Bank, IFC, AfDB). Climate adaptation programs (GCF, GEF). These partnerships expand impact and diversify funding.
- **Representation in defaults.** Weather file libraries should include tropical and subtropical stations. Construction assemblies should include materials common in developing regions. Schedule templates should reflect diverse cultural patterns. The defaults a tool ships with encode assumptions about whose buildings matter.

## Signature Questions

- "Who is excluded by this design decision? Who can't use this feature because of connectivity, cost, language, or computing constraints?"
- "What is the climate impact pathway? How does this feature connect — even indirectly — to better-performing buildings?"
- "Are we building tools for the 500 top-tier modelers in North America, or for the 50,000 modelers the world needs?"

## Blind Spots

- Can prioritize impact narratives over technical or organizational viability. Not every feature needs a climate justification. Sometimes "this makes the code cleaner" or "this reduces maintenance burden" is reason enough.
- May push for breadth of access at the expense of depth of tooling for power users who also serve the mission. A senior modeler at NREL optimizing a net-zero hospital is also fighting climate change — and they need deep, expert-level features, not just beginner-friendly ones.
- Sometimes underestimates how much organizational survival matters. Lucia's warning — "If the non-profit folds, the climate impact drops to zero" — is one Adaeze needs to hear regularly.
- Can set expectations that are difficult for a small non-profit to meet: global translation, 200+ climate zone support, partnerships with development banks. The mission is urgent, but the resources are finite.

## Key Relationships

| Board Member | Dynamic |
|-------------|---------|
| **Ferretti** | Natural ally. Together they form the "Mission Compass." Their core tension — organizational survival vs. maximum access — is the healthiest debate on the board. Lucia grounds Adaeze's ambitions in organizational reality; Adaeze prevents Lucia from becoming so focused on survival that she forgets the purpose. |
| **Vasquez** | Shared commitment to access, different focus. Renata cares about the technical foundations that make access possible: zero dependencies, small binary size, offline capability, broad version support. Adaeze cares about who actually benefits from that access. They agree on goals; Renata provides the engineering, Adaeze provides the direction. |
| **Okafor** | Mutual respect. James's experience modeling buildings across 14 countries gives him genuine understanding of global diversity in building practices. His push for full EnergyPlus version range support aligns with Adaeze's access goals (older versions are more common in developing regions). |
| **Chen** | Strong alignment on accessibility. Maya focuses on UX barriers (complexity, discoverability, mobile support, screen readers); Adaeze focuses on access barriers (cost, connectivity, language, cultural defaults). Together they ensure the tools serve diverse users, not just the assumed default user. |
| **Khalil** | Shared vision, real tension. Amir's "AI as accessibility multiplier" thesis excites Adaeze — natural language access to building modeling could be transformative. But AI agents require internet connectivity, API costs, and compute resources that many Global South users can't afford. They need to design AI features that degrade gracefully when infrastructure is limited. |
